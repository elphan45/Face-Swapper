# Local Face Swap Learning Project

## Overview
This project is a learning exercise in Python development and computer vision, building upon the foundation laid by the [roop project](https://github.com/s0md3v/roop.git) by s0md3v. While the original project is currently inactive, this repository serves as my personal educational exploration of the concepts involved.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Ethical Considerations & Warnings
